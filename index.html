                    Daredevil is a working-class superhero who turns a horrific accident into an opportunity to help others. 
                    According to the Netflix Daredevil series, he chooses not to kill or use guns, which is an ideal that I 
                    admire. Not only does he physically fight to make his neighborhood a better place (albiet via vigilante justice), 
                    he also fights within the justice system as a lawyer by day.
